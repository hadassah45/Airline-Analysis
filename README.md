# Airline-Analysis and Airplane crashes project


# Problem statement
story telling with visuals

1. your task will be to understudy this data and tell a story about the entire flight experience
2. Tell a visual story from this Data and let us notice what we wouldn't have without your work
 

# Data source
Two different dataset were used for this project and they are gotten from kaggle
delayed flight dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jimschacko/airlines-dataset-to-predict-a-delay
Airplane crashes since 1908: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurograndi/airplane-crashes-since-1908 

# Data cleaning
for the airplane crash dataset, I created two new column and extracted year and month from the new column to newly created column. I did this so I did this so I can show some findings from the dataset against the month and the year. The aim is to develop visuals that show the stakeholders the trend and possible relationships between some variables and the years.

I converted the day number to day number into a new column so that the visuals can be clear and compelling to the stakeholders.


# Insights
A dashboard that display the insight was created and attched to this file.
Insights from the dashboard, 
[Airline and airplane Analysis.pdf](https://github.com/hadassah45/Airline-Analysis/files/9252801/Airline.and.airplane.Analysis.pdf)

1. WN, OO,XE,US,US,UA Airlines recorded the highest number of delayed flights in the corresponding order
2. The number of passengers onboard increased significantly along the years with 1989 being the year with the largest number of passengers aboard.
3. the number of people aboard is relative to the number of fatalities recorded i.e the higher the number of people aboard when a plane crashes, the higher the number of fatalities recorded and vice versa.
4. The word cloud visuals recorded some key words from the summary of the dataset and some words were mentioned more frequently than others. these words are moutains, engines, weather and disappered. I deduce that these could have been some of the possible causes of the crashes.


Recommendations
The airlines which recorded the highest number of delay should develop good and structured strategies on how to reduce delayed flights.
